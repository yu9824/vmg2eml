# VMG2EML

Convert a `*.vmg` file to `*.eml` files.

## Usage

for single file

```
python3 -m vmg2eml /path/to/vmgfile
```

OR

for multiple file (`./input/*.vmg`)

```
python3 main.py
```

## Environment

My version is python 3.9.13, but I think the other python v3 is compatible.

Only standard libraries are used.
